<p>His so called friends were actually conspiring against him. Selina and Anika were definitely trying to find ways for him and Bruce to start a relationship. It wasn't that he didn't want that, he did. That was the shocking part. He had never had a crush on someone before yet here he was.</p>

<p>The issue was who it was. He was just a random guy. He could not date someone like Bruce. They were too far apart. Edward has never left the city and has had to work his ass off for even the smallest of things.</p>

<p>He was trying to rationalize it. Every point failed. Bruce was in college to get his own degree and to make something of himself separate of his status and wealth. He was even living somewhere a rich person wouldn't pick. He drove a normal car, nothing lavish, and wore clothes Edward would find in a discount bin.</p>

<p>Ah. He knew why he was in turmoil. The term was "too good to be true". Something had to be wrong.</p>

<p>'Plus if I confess things <i>will</i> be awkward between us despite what Selina said.' Edward was laying on his bed that his friends built for him just a few days ago. Edward was good at adjusting to new environments, but this space was supposed to be his yet it didn't feel like it. That was due to the room feeling so small with three people living here.</p>

<p>At least everything else was squared away and rent <i>was</i> a lot cheaper.. He rolled off the bed and trudged into the bathroom and turned on the shower. He looked at himself in the mirror, analyzing his face then taking his glasses off and squinted at himself.</p>

<p>Bruce was hot. That was a fact. Edward was not appealing in any regards. He took off his shirt and frowned. Edward was too tall, too thin, lanky, yet he had a pudge. Somehow he was many things in one, and good-looking was not one of those.</p>

<p>He had no chance with Bruce.</p>

<p>Even if somehow, someway, Bruce found him even remotely ok to look at the press would not. It would get out a Wayne was gay which was almost unheard of from popular media icons, and they would tear them both apart like dogs. Edward undressed and got in the shower and tried to let the water drown his anxiety away.</p>

<p>Things couldn't just be simple. So many walls were in the way, but were emotions enough of a bulldozer to tear them down? Edward rubbed his face as if that would help. He focused on trying to just zone out and stop existing for a moment.</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Fall was horribly cold in Gotham, but luckily it was nothing like the winter winds. That didn't mean the walk from class to his car was all flowers and sunshine. Bruce felt bad for anyone who had to walk more than ten minutes during days like this. He got in his car and pulled out.</p>

<p>It was only a three minute drive but a thirteen minute walk (that Edward insisted on walking sometimes!) Bruce parked his car and grabbed his bag before trudging inside. He was going to layer up for whenever they go to a pumpkin patch.</p>

<p>Bruce entered and threw his backpack onto the couch. Just as he was going to walk to the bedroom his eyes landed on the bathroom. Edward was blowdrying his hair so the noise muted Bruce's entrance. Luckily he was in just boxers. Unluckily for Bruce he was <i>just</i> in boxers.</p>

<p>He felt his ears heat up a bit. Edward refused to show any skin that wasn't his head or hands ninety percent of the time. The other times were his legs. Truthfully he could not help but stare, at least for a moment.</p>

<p>Edward was pale but not gauntly. He had some moles and faded scars, mainly around his knees so most likely due to childhood activities. While he did look scrawny, it wasn't unappealing by any means. No body was perfect, everyone had flaws. He found it enduring how Edward was something he had never seen before. And it was beautiful.</p>

<p>Bruce walked over and knocked on the doorframe to not startle Edward. He turned off the air dryer and slid on his glasses that were half foggy from the humidity. "You're here early. How was class?"</p>

<p>"I'm actually on time." Bruce scratched his own jaw as he focused all of his willpower to not look anywhere that wasn't Edward's face right now. "Class was alright. Boring."</p>

<p>"Huh? Shit. What time is it? God damnit the water bill-" Edward's emotions were almost always completely neutral. Bruce could hardly figure out what he was thinking or feeling a lot of the time. Even when he did show his emotions they were complex. It wouldn't be just anger, but something that was indescribable.</p>

<p>He seemed angry right now, but it wasn't just that. A mix of guilt, anger, conflict, shame, and perhaps bitterness. He could see all of it and none at the same time. Bruce took the hair dryer and sent a quick gust into Edward's face, making him short circuit. "It's just a shower. Stop worrying to death over it. You enjoyed it and clearly needed it."</p>

<p>Bruce then pushed off the door frame and left to go and change, leaving Edward there to contemplate just what the hell happened. He did return a minute later with a change of clothes for Edward.</p>

<p>"Did you go through my things?" Edward huffed out, but his words held no malice. "Of course, just like how you go through mine."</p>

<p>"It isn't my damn fault you forgot to do the laundry so I needed to borrow something." Edward defended himself and slid on his jeans. He held up the sweatshirt Bruce picked out for him and gave him a confused look.</p>

<p>"It's cold as balls outside." Bruce shrugged. The sweatshirt in question was huge, even on Bruce, but it kept the wind out perfectly. Edward slid it on and fixed his glasses, glancing at himself in the mirror. "I look tiny in this."</p>

<p>It was a weird feeling seeing someone you loved wearing your clothes. A good weird, that is. It was not pride or possession, but something akin to enjoying sharing with them. "Well I think you look cute."</p>

<p>Bruce saw clear as day how Edward flinched at his comment. That typically meant bad or dislike, but he was observant. He knew Edward a bit from months of being his friend. The guy could not take a compliment if his life depended on it. So it was his goal to give Edward a compliment a day, but this was the first time he got a reaction like this.</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah." Edward mumbled and brushed past him to go to the kitchen. Showers sometimes meant being solely alone with your thoughts, and that on top of his attitude over discord today.. It was likely he wasn't in a good state of mind right now. Bruce went into the bedroom and dug through some of Selina's things. He found just what he was looking for and went to go find Edward again.</p>

<p>'There is no fucking way he said that.' Edward opened their fridge and pulled out a carton of milk and poured himself a cup. 'He's just insane.' Edward nearly slammed the fridge door shut. He paused and breathed slow and deep. 'I need to calm down. Bruce will catch on I am feeling horrible and then start pestering me in his attempts to make me feel better.'</p>

<p>He opened a cabinet and pulled out a package of oreos. When he turned around he saw Bruce holding something behind his back. 'God he is quick to figure me out. ..is that bad? Should I be concerned?' Edward leaned against the counter and held an oreo under the milk. "Spit it out, what are you planning?"</p>

<p>Bruce showed him what he was hiding. It was a suduko book. He stared at it, then up to Bruce's face to see he was smiling. Edward sighed softly and took it. "I swear to god its impossible to be upset around you."</p>

<p>"So it worked?" Bruce asked curiously, reaching for an oreo. Edward ate his own and nodded, refusing to look him in the eye. "Can I ask what happened? Did someone do something?"</p>

<p>Edward finished his bite of oreo and shifted his weight to sit on the counter. "No. And before you start worrying again it wasn't because of you either." He watched Bruce's shoulders slump slightly which indicated to Edward he <i>was</i> worried about that. Bruce only ate half of the oreo which was amusing to Edward since he had seen this guy stuff him mouth full on things like shitty hamburgers.</p>

<p>"I'm fine. Don't worry about it." He dunked another oreo in the milk and stared at it. "Ed.." Ah, shit. That tone. "Edward we are friends, right?"</p>

<p>"When did I get demoted to friend?" Edward jokingly teased. Bruce opened his mouth, then closed it. "You know what I meant.." He sighed softly. "I don't like it when my best friend is upset, and especially when I have no clue why."</p>

<p>Edward pulled the oreo out and held it against Bruce's mouth for him to take if he wanted. Bruce did, but seemed rather flustered.</p>

<p>"Self hatred is a bitch. Nothing you can fix." Edward picked up the cup and sipped on the milk, hoping this conversation would end on that.</p>

<p>When he set down the cup he saw Bruce looking very determined. He stood in front of Edward and crossed his arms. "Name five things wrong with you."</p>

<p>Edward blinked, taken aback. "What?" "You heard me." Bruce was staring at him seriously.</p>

<p>"Christ, ok." He shuffled a bit, not daring to look him in the eyes right now. This situation sucked. "Do I really have to tell you why I hate myself?"</p>

<p>"No, but if you don't I'll go on a tangent about everything I see about you thats amazing." Bruce argued. Fucking hell he was screwed. Both options were horrible.</p>

<p>"Alright." Edward held up his hand and added a diget every time he listed something out. "I'm weak as shit, I'm downright ugly, I'm an asshole and do not tell me otherwise, I'm disgusting, and," Edward did find it hard to list anything out. He just.. didn't like himself. "I'm a nothing nobody who just wants to exist silentely and fade away."</p>

<p>Bruce didn't move or interject him at any point. When Edward was done was when he finally spoke up. "And have you tried to change yourself?" Edward felt anger boil up. "Of course I have. I-" "Really?" Bruce cut him off. "What makes you think you <i>are</i> weak and ugly? what makes you an asshole, because I <b>have</b> seen my fair share of true scum and you are no where near that. I have no idea how you think you're disgusting because since you got here our place has been cleaner than before we moved in, and that last point is just something you want."</p>

<p>Edward couldn't speak. He just glared at the ground and tried not to let his emotions spill out. He inhaled slowly, then finally dragged his gaze upwards to meet Bruce's piercing one. "You truly are impossible to be sad around." He took off his glasses and frowned. "I don't know why you care. It's not like we will be like this after college."</p>

<p>Bruce gently took his glasses and set them aside. "What do you mean?" "The second we graduate we will have our own lives. You will go back to Wayne tower and get a job or something. I will get my own job and place."</p>

<p>"Edward.." Bruce reached up and rubbed his shoulder. "Change is apart of life. Just because new things happen doesn't mean the worst outcome will happen every time. If you don't change with it then things will fall apart. So what if we get two different jobs, how do you think other people still keep friends from years ago? You don't just stop talking to them."</p>

<p>Edward slid off the counter and made a move to leave. He had to. This was almost too much. The hand on his shoulder held him back, and before Edward could protest Bruce pulled him into his chest. The taller froze, then closed his eyes and pressed his head into Bruce's shoulder. "you're the worst friend." He mumbled into the cloth.</p>

<p>Bruce rubbed his back and smiled softly. "I'm so horrible for not letting you be sad." He understood this fear. Edward did not have a lot of people in his life before this, so of course he was terrified of losing them. "If you think you can get rid of us that easily you are mistaken."</p>

<p>This got a weak chuckle from Edward who hid his face more. "Oh? Was that a smile I saw?" Bruce teased and tried to pull Edward away to see it. Instead, the other wrapped his arms around Bruce to keep himself locked there. He leaned against the counter and laid his head against Edward's with the both of them now gently holding one another.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Edward slid off of him and put on his glasses. He smiled at Bruce. "I really am okay now." He grabbed the last oreo and split it in half, giving part of it to Bruce.</p>

<p>"I swear you have to be half sugar." Bruce took it and popped it into his mouth. "Oh shut up I eat healthy." Edward bickered back and finished the cup of milk. "Sushi is the only thing I see you eat thats close to healthy."</p>

<p>"Sorry moneybags but fruit is fucking expensive. Let me just boil some lettuce to appease you." Edward mocked as he cleaned the cup. Before Bruce could retort the front door opened. "We're back~!" Selina called out. She walked inside and poked her head into the kitchen. "Oh? Did it happen?"</p>

<p>Both of them blushed. Bruce shook his head while Edward glared at her. "Selina what the hell!"</p>

<p>She shrugged innocently and stuck her tongue out. Anika hugged Selina from behind and looked at the two flustered men. "Lets go get some pumpkins to slaughter."</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Selina and Anika picked out medium sized pumpkins that matched somewhat. Bruce had gotten one that was taller than it was wide while Edward got one with a lot of lumps and blemishes on it.</p>

<p>"Not because it was cheap for this size." Was Edward's excuse. None of them believed him of course.</p>

<p>Anika set out newspaper on the biggest table they had, Selina went to get everyone knives and scoopers, and Bruce and Edward brought in the pumpkins. They set them down on top of the newspaper. Anika pulled out a cookie tray. "Eddie where's your seasoning?" "Should be in the left cabinet."</p>

<p>Bruce gave them a strange look. "What are you cooking? The.. Pumpkin..?" He genuinely had no idea. Edward took off the big sweatshirt and looked at Bruce. "Seriously? You've never eaten pumpkin seeds?" The blank look he got as a reply spoke volumes.</p>

<p>Anika set the spices down and hummed. "We scoop out the seeds, clean off the pumpkin guts, season them, and bake them." She took off her shirt, leaving only her bra. Selina smirked and did the same, but she only had a tank top. Bruce suddenly felt overdressed. He had never really carved a pumpkin before but followed their lead and took off his own bulky sweatshirt. Selina pulled the trashcan over and left it open.</p>

<p>Edward grabbed a knife and began to cut a hole in the bottom of the pumpkin while Selina and Anika were cutting around the stem. Bruce was throughly confused why everyone was doing this a different way. It seemed Edward noticed how hesitant he was and motioned for him to stand beside him. "Watch how I do it. I've done this every year since I could remember."</p>

<p>Cutting a hole in the pumpkin was a long and tedious process that didn't go perfectly, but he eventually was able to pop the bottom out. The smell of fresh pumpkin filled the room and Bruce suddenly saw why they took off their clothes.</p>

<p>Edward dug his hand straight into it and pulled out a massive glob of very wet and bright orange pumpkin guts. he sifted through it and dropped any seeds onto the cookie sheet while the guts went into the trash. Anika and Selina were not far behind doing the same. Bruce took Edward's knife and began to make his own hole around the stem, cutting it in an octagon shape and pulling it off.</p>

<p>Everyone's arms and hands were covered in pumpkin goo except Bruces. Edward noticed this and smiled at him knowingly. "I can de-gut your pumpkin for you." He knew how Bruce felt about touching wet food. This was probably akin to that. "Thank you."</p>

<p>Everyone worked while chatting about random things, slowly filling the cookie sheet up with seeds. Selina finished hers first and washed her arms, then cleaned the seeds up. "Bruce can you season the seeds and pop them in the oven?"</p>

<p>While he did that Edward and Anika washed their own arms free of gunk.</p>

<p>Edward sat down in front of his pumpkin and rotated it around, debating what to make. Anika got to work on making hers have a scary looking face while Selina pulled out her phone for a reference image in how to make a cute cat pumpkin.</p>

<p>Bruce slid the sheet into the oven and sat beside Edward. "What are you gonna make?" Edward hummed and tilted his head to the side, contemplating. "I'm thinking a zombie.. it works well with all the bumps and green bits. What about you?" He looked up at Bruce.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I'm carving a pumpkin, so I think I'll just do a basic goofy face."</p>

<p>It took another hour before they were done carving their pumpkins. Selina turned hers around first to show she had a cat face that utilized the pumpkin skin stuck to itself via toothpicks to form ears, whiskers, and a tail. Anika showed hers next to show a toothy demon looking face. Edward had made a zombie as best as he could, but realism was hard so he went with a more stylized version. Bruce had a typical pumpkin face with big eyes as square teeth.</p>

<p>"Where are the candles?" Anika asked. "God damnit I knew I forgot something." Selina grumbled out, frustrated. Edward got up and pulled the pumpkin seeds out of the oven and set it on the stovetop to cool. He yawned and picked up the sweatshirt he discarded, slipping it on and sitting back down.</p>

<p>"i can't believe you forgot the candles." Bruce leaned against the table and sighed. "All this effort is now wasted." He jokingly teased. "Damn! I'm sorry, alright? It isn't a typical thing to buy, okay?" She got up and stretched. "We need to watch a scary movie.."</p>

<p>"Oh hell yes." Edward stood up with a shit eating grin. "What about Saw?" Selina waved her hand at his suggestion. "Dude everyone's seen Saw. Have you watched Babadook?"</p>

<p>"No. Sounds.. weird. I like it. I'll get the living room set up." Edward walked out of the kitchen to go get the movie night ready for them. Selina and Anika turned to Bruce instantly with a knowing look. "Did you two kiss yet?"</p>

<p>"No. Selina, we talked about this. There's no way Edward loves me like that." Bruce sighed softly. "We.. did hug though. And he shared his oreos with me."</p>

<p>"You two are practically married then." Anika rolled her eyes then crossed her arms. "I bet your ass he does love you. Try to make a move on him tonight."</p>

<p>"What? No! You're both here anyway." Bruce stood up and started to clean up, hoping they'd drop the subject. "Brucie." Selina hugged him from behind. "Me and Anika are going to cuddle one another during the movie since it's so cold." She dropped her voice to hint 'your move should be to cuddle him.'</p>

<p>"He wouldn't like that." Bruce said flatly, tossing the newspapers into the garbage. "And how do you know? Just try it." "No."</p>

<p>Anika tutted and waved her hand. "Well you know what we need to do then, Selina." "Yep."</p>

<p>Bruce looked between them and glared suspiciously. "What are you going to do?" "You'll have to see~" God damnit his friends were horrible.</p>

<p>Edward was in the middle of the couch with the movie up but paused, ready to go. Anika walked in with the pumpkin seeds and sat beside Edward to share the food with. Selina walked over with two sodas and sat beside Anika, nudging her. "Don't hog that, damn."</p>

<p>Bruce turned off the light and walked in, sitting beside Edward very tensely. All four of them could fit but it was making them have to be right beside one another.</p>

<p>Edward grabbed a handful of seeds and ate a few before offering some to Bruce. He curiously took one and popped it into his mouth. It was salty and had a strange texture, but he liked it. Edward started the movie and everyone got situated eating pumpkin seeds and watching Babadook. After a while Edward got up to go to the kitchen. "Ed, can you get me something to drink too?" Bruce whispered to him. He nodded and went to do just that.</p>

<p>There was no soda left.</p>

<p>'Selina.. you mother fucker.' He looked back into the living room to see two soda cans. One was open and she was sharing with Anika. The other was not open. He knew what this was. He sat back down and reached his arm around Anika to poke Selina. She looked at him with amusement in her eyes and wordlessly handed him the soda.</p>

<p>Edward opened it after casting an angry glance to her. Bruce gently nudged him with expectant eyes silently asking 'wheres mine?'. "This is the last one." He handed Bruce the can to <s>reluctantly</s> share with him. He stared at it before quietly thanking him and taking a sip then setting it down. The four of them continued to eat at the pumpkin seeds as the climax of the movie started.</p>

<p>By now the food was eaten and set aside. Anika scooted closer to Edward and began to snuggle <i>him</i>. Of course Bruce noticed this, but he was a bit shocked when Edward hardly noticed it. It didn't even seem to take him out of the movie. He looked to Selina, watching her cuddle Anika and hold her hand.</p>

<p>They truly were diabolical into getting them to do anything together. And damnit.. it worked. He inched closer to Edward and. put his arm around him and Anika. To his delight the other leaned against him somewhat. Edward pulled his legs up and under the sweatshirt.</p>

<p>Bruce was hardly paying attention to the movie right now. Edward looked so tiny somehow. It was adorable. He leaned against him and made a risky play to lay his head against Edward, then turned his attention to the movie. The final act played out, yet somehow Bruce couldn't be bothered to really focus on it. He had what he wanted right here and now.</p>

<p>"That was a really unique ending." Edward spoke first after it ended, then reality hit. He looked at Anika confused. "Why're you cuddling me?"</p>

<p>"You're warmer than Selina." "Wha-- RUDE!" Selina playfully whacked her. Edward chuckled softly and stretched his legs before turning to Bruce. "You were cold too?"</p>

<p>Not really, and Edward wasn't a heater. However.. "Yeah. Is that ok?" This response made Edward roll his eyes. Selina got up and threw a blanket over them. "Find another movie for us to watch. I'ma go piss."</p>

<p>Edward took the blanket and draped it over Bruce first, which made his heart stutter. Bruce grabbed the edge of it and pulled the rest over Edward. He didn't want any possibility of this moment slipping away. Anika was flipping through the movie selections trying to find anything to watch while those two figured out their "we are friends but cuddling" situation.</p>

<p>It ended with Edward leaning against Bruce halfway, their shoulders overlapping one another to do so. Bruce was not complaining, and neither was Edward. For the next movie Selina and Anika cuddled one another on one side of the couch while Bruce and Edward half cuddled on the other.</p>

<p>This was truly one of the best nights they had all had in a long time.</p>
