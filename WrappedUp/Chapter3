    </p></div>
</div>

<p>Bruce got up from the couch and walked into the bedroom where Edward was. Before he could finish that sentence he was typing he sat on his bed. Edward looked up from his phone, clearly conflicted. Bruce understood, though. This was probably Edward's first Christmas with friends he cared about.</p>

<p>"Save your money." Bruce smiled at him a bit. "You're far too nice for your own good."</p>

<p>Edward set his phone down and huffed, sitting up but not looking Bruce in the eyes. He felt a hand on his shoulder yet did not react. Bruce pulled Edward into himself and rubbed his shoulder a bit. "Eddie stop sulking. I know I am beyond lucky to have the wealth I do, so don't feel guilty if what anyone else gets you is worth more than what you got them."</p>

<p>Edward had been tense the entire time, and Bruce could hear him holding his breath. Suddenly he breathed in, then fully leaned against him. Bruce shuffled onto the bed before guiding them to lay down with no protest from Edward.</p>

<p>Truly, he loved this man. Loving someone was not as easy as listing out the things you enjoyed about them. It was all of the small things they did, just <i>being</i> themselves. He loved waking up to seeing Edward squinting as he got ready for the day, or whenever Selina teased him he was able to tell if Edward had a good retort or not based on how tense his shoulders were.</p>

<p>So having Edward completely relaxed in his hold but saying nothing was new. It was a new side to him, something akin to vulnerability. "Are you alright?" Bruce said quietly, gently rubbing his arm. Edward shrugged and reached up, taking off his glasses and setting them aside. He gave Bruce a weary glance before settling down beside him again. "Why?"</p>

<p>One word, so vague yet so telling. Bruce didn't know what he was referring to specifically, but he could make an educated guess. "I don't want or need <i>things</i>, and neither does Selina or Anika. Presents are just things to gift to people to show you like them." Bruce rolled over and pulled Edward into a close hug. "They are not necessary, especially for college students working to get by. The only thing I really want is you guys."</p>

<p>Edward was slowly tensing up, then it vanished. He wouldn't look Bruce in the eye but it seemed to click for him. "Then why did you get us so many?" Bruce sighed softly with a small chuckle. "Honestly most of that shit is food or necessity items."</p>

<p>"If you got me socks I will kill you." Edward mumbled, finally feeling better enough to start joking. Now it was Bruce's turn to go silent. "You... You got me <i>socks?</i>" He then snorted a bit and fully laid beside Bruce with a small blush coating the tips of his ears. "I needed some.."</p>

<p>"I know." Bruce stared at the small gap in between them. It was unspoken, but the both of them had been steadily testing waters for weeks now. They were quite comfortable with cuddling due to Selina's antics when she made them cuddle during the movie. After that sitting beside one another or brushes against the skin weren't awkward. It was almost two months since that movie and, well, Bruce was addicted to holding Edward.</p>

<p>Edward rolled his eyes and moved Bruce's hand off his shoulder finally. "How did you know I needed socks?" Before Bruce could feel worried he did something wrong <s>why would Edward move his hand--?</s>, Edward closed whatever gap was between them and lifted the blanket up and over them both. "It's fucking cold, you better replace all that warmth you stole."</p>

<p>Bruce smiled just a bit and laid on his side to hug Edward close with one arm over him. "Mismatched socks.. and I also do the laundry remember?" Bruce smirked a bit, closing his eyes and letting himself relax fully. This was the best gift he could get right now. A cold day snuggling with Edward. "Yeah yeah I'm working on paying off my cold debt."</p>

<p>They laid like that for a while, both aware the other was awake, but nothing felt wrong. Neither were anxious, worried, or anything else of that matter.</p>

<p>They were enjoying the time together to the fullest.</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Edward was going to figure out how he could get away with murder.</p>

<p>Currently he was in the living room with Bruce, Selina, and Anika for an early Christmas before they all departed for the break. Selina had gifted Anika a really cute bra but this was not the time for that. Sure they were close friends, so Edward didn't mind much until Edward opened his gift from Selina. It had been quite a heavy box, so he was curious.</p>

<p>Selina <b>burst</b> into laughter when the wrapping paper revealed a brick. Just a random red brick with a note written by Selina, Anika, and Bruce on three of the faces. Edward's total confusion seeing just a brick (as he had opened it only seeing an unwritten side), was priceless. So much so that Anika and Bruce even chuckled.</p>

<p>When he turned it over he stared at the short writing. Bruce saw how his body trembled and instantly knew what was up. Edward thumbed the texture and looked down to try and hide his face.</p>

<p>It was a stupid gift, but he loved it. It genuinely meant a lot to him. Then he felt Selina's arms around him as she pulled him into a hug. Edward set the brick aside and hugged her tightly, burring his head into her neck and trying to fight back the swell of emotions threatening to spill out. Even if it was just a brick it was clearly thought out and deliberate. Especially since all three had worked together to do this.</p>

<p>He had gotten everyone a card and at least two gifts. Selina got him a lot of oreos, Anika with new earbuds, and Bruce.. Bruce did tell the truth. Socks, underwear, a new toothbrush, and a brand new big sweatshirt to fight off the cold. He did not hesitate to put it on, truly honored to have friends like this. Edward looked over to watch Bruce open his gifts and to watch for his reaction.</p>

<p>He opened the smallest gift from Edward first and pulled out a keychain which held an image of the four of them smiling at the camera. Anika had the idea of a group photo a while ago and Edward ordered a keychain of it for Bruce to use. Bruce had not reacted yet, though. Just stared at it, frozen. Edward shuffled to sit beside him and bumped into his side gently.</p>

<p>"This.." Bruce ran his thumb over the chain part, his lips quivering. "Edward I really like this." His voice was taught, trying to keep it level. Edward reached over and pulled Bruce into himself, half hugging him. "After what you told me I realized i was being a fool. The amount of gifts doesn't matter when its the thought that counts." Edward gently squeezed his arm. "I hope you won't burst into tears at the rest." Edward whispered into his ear with a smirk. Bruce rolled his eyes playfully and sat up. He stared at the keychain another moment longer before opening the rest of his gifts.</p>

<p>After everyone opened their presents and cleaned up they watched the Grinch while Selina and Anika got high and made jokes the entire film. Edward was fully in the sweatshirt, legs and all, so Bruce had to get creative with how they snuggled. He had Edward leaning against him as he held him with one arm.</p>

<p>Halfway into the movie Edward stretched his legs, leaving the cocoon he made. He got up and left, leaving Bruce quite cold and feeling empty. He looked to Selina and Anika who were watching him with knowing smirks. Bruce just rolled his eyes and tried his best to ignore them. Luckily Edward returned moments later with a fluffy blanket and sat beside Bruce.</p>

<p>He draped the blanket over them both, but made no move to lean against him like before. Bruce decided to take a risk and moved closer. Seeing no reaction from Edward he continued and laid his head on his shoulder. Edward had a boney shoulder, but honestly who <i>didn't</i>? Bruce did not mind.</p>

<p>What shocked him was when Edward moved his arm to hold Bruce close. This truly felt like heaven in this moment. He could hardly care for the movie right now. It was rare he felt this safe, so he enjoyed the moment while it lasted.</p>

<p>When the movie was over Edward turned his head to look at Bruce who had not moved an inch since he started cuddling him like this. He realized within a second that Bruce had fallen asleep. This was bad for several reasons. Bruce was a light sleeper, so if Edward moved too much he would wake up. While that would be good if he wanted to escape.. Everyone here knew about Bruce's horrid sleeping habits. So much so that Edward was positive Bruce rarely if ever got enough sleep.</p>

<p>This meant if Edward got up Bruce would wake up and <i>stay</i> awake for god knows how long after. He heard and felt something light land beside him and looked down to see a pillow. "Don't you dare wake him up." Selina said practically with a purr in her voice as if she planned this from the beginning.</p>

<p>Edward sighed and made do with what he had in this situation. Sure he and Bruce cuddled occasionally, or were in one anothers vicinity when the other was sleeping, but not like this. He could feel just how fast his heart was pumping thinking how he was essentially trapped, forced to cuddle Bruce, and most likely sleep beside him.</p>

<p>He was really being forced here. Escape was nonexistent. Not when Bruce looked as relaxed as he had ever seen him before.</p>

<p>Edward slowly laid down and maneuvered Bruce slightly so they would be as comfortable as two guys sharing a couch could be when sleeping. He fixed up the blanket before taking off his glasses and setting them aside. Bruce was currently sleeping on his side with one arm on Edward's chest and a leg intertwined with his own.</p>

<p>'Just don't think about it.' Edward told himself. It really felt nice to fall sleep beside someone you loved and trusted. It was hard to feel cold at the same time. Edward didn't know how long it took for him to finally doze off, but for once it was not a long process.</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Selina and Anika had left with goodbyes already. Edward was already packed and ready to go to visit the Wayne manor, and <i>only</i> because someone he cared deeply for invited him to be there. He walked outside to the car where Bruce was picking out a playlist for the trip and tossed his bags inside.</p>

<p>Edward sat in the passenger seat, buckled, then put his hands in his sweatshirt pocket. Bruce looked at him up and down before offering his phone to him. "You pick out what we listen to for the hour drive." Edward looked at the phone, then to Bruce. He slowly took it and scrolled around before deciding on one of Bruce's.</p>

<p>"You picked an old one." Bruce said with a small smile, pulling out of the driveway and getting on the road. When he got no reply he knew what was going on. "Ed, there is no reason to be this nervous."</p>

<p>Edward huffed in slight annoyance. "A random nobody like me has only dreamed what could be in a mansion, let alone a billionaires. Of course I am going to feel nervous, awkward, and quite frankly terrified."</p>

<p>Bruce pulled onto the highway then turned the music down a bit. "I'll be there with you, and its just a building. <i>My</i> building, might I add."</p>

<p>Edward rested his head on his hand and stared out the window. "Even if its yours it won't feel like you. It will feel like a stuck up rich person lives there with servants and shit scurrying about."</p>

<p>"Really?" Bruce hummed. "I think you'll be surprised then."</p>

<p>"I really hate how vague you're being rather than just telling me outright." Edward picked up Bruce's phone and tapped in the password before changing the song. Bruce glanced at him from the corner of his eye. "Ed? How did you know my password?"</p>

<p>Edward set his phone in the console between them and shrugged. "Thought it was obvious. I always accidentally saw you input some numbers, then realized it was a birthday. I don't know who's though."</p>

<p>Bruce smiled a bit, not weirded out solely because he did the same. He had figured out Edward's password via a similar way. Not that he went into it when Edward wasn't looking, though! "It's Alfred's birthday."</p>

<p>Edward obviously went through every person he knew in his head. Bruce could see the gears turning in place. He had never told Edward who Alfred was, so he should have no idea.</p>

<p>By the time the next song played Edward sat up and turned to him. "It's your butler."</p>

<p>Bruce nearly failed to hold back the surprise on his face. "How'd you know?" He glanced at Edward with a smile just in time to see that <i>look</i> in his eyes. The one that told him he was working on solving a puzzle and could visualize the answer. He loved that expression.</p>

<p>"You never talk about your parents for.. obvious reasons. You must have someone that they trusted to take care of you. You mentioned a few times in some stories someone teaching you how to do certain things. It had to be someone you didn't want to talk about with us due to our upbringing, so probably someone who works at your manor."</p>

<p>Edward paused, then leaned back in the chair. "Your father figure."</p>

<p>"Damn Ed," Bruce chuckled a bit. "I wanted you and Alfred to meet one another without knowing much about each other but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore."</p>

<p>"Sorry." Edward grumbled and looked out the window again. Bruce just knew he felt like he ruined something and reached over, patting Edward on the leg. "It's fine, seriously. I didn't want you guys feeling weird about it or teasing me about my butler. He's great."</p>

<p>Edward looked at his hand, then up to Bruce. "You mean Selina teasing you."</p>

<p>Bruce couldn't contain his grin. "I think you'd also tease me for having a Butler, would you not?" Edward hummed in thought. "Only when necessary."</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>From the second they passed the gate Bruce could see Edward's lax demeanor change. He pulled into the garage and parked his car, accidentally making the situation worse as they were suddenly surrounded by silence. Edward took a breath then got out. He opened the back door and grabbed his bag that he packed for the week.</p>

<p>Bruce followed suit, though he didn't bring much unlike Edward. "You alright?" He asked before anything else could happen. Edward locked eyes with him, then nodded. "I swear to god if you leave me alone I will kill you." Bruce nodded, fully understanding Edward was completely out of his element here. "Thank you for spending winter break with me."</p>

<p>The door opened before Bruce could go to grab the knob. Typical Alfred. Edward looked up to see a well dressed older man holding a neutral expression stare at him, clearly doing a quick assessment. "Welcome."</p>

<p>Even his voice was properly level and calm. It made Edward uncomfortable, but not entirely. Bruce walked in first and smiled softly at Alfred. Edward noticed the slight inflextion of his wrinkles. 'Why is Alfred surprised to see Bruce smiling?' It made sense after some thought, though. When Edward met Bruce getting any smile out of him took a lot. He hadn't realized until now just how much he was grinning every day.</p>

<p>"Alfred, this is Edward. Edward, Alfred." Bruce introduced them when they were all inside. Edward extended his hand and shook his. "Nice to meet you, Edward. May I take your things?"</p>

<p>Edward was staring at their hands. 'He didn't grip hard. Thank god.' "Oh, uh," Edward glanced at Bruce, then back to Alfred. "No, I'd rather keep ahold of them." No fuss, no questions, nothing. Just respect and a nod. Edward felt the slight unease he held for this new person vanishing. Plus, if Bruce clearly saw him as family then Edward should at minimum tolerate him.</p>

<p>"I was informed of another joining us this year and that you are not picky, but that is the only information I was told." Despite his flat tone even Edward could see the dripping annoyance in his words, a silent tell to Bruce. "What foods do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"I'm really not picky, anything is fine." Edward felt more at ease, but he was still a snail in its shell. Alfred raised an eyebrow and hummed. "I asked what you <i>prefer</i> so I can work around that."</p>

<p>"Oh, u-uh." Edward found himself moving ever so closely back to Bruce. "I like soup." Good enough. Alfred seemed pleased with this answer. Bruce gently nudged Edward. "Lets go set our stuff down."</p>

<p>Edward wasn't sure where to go, so he just followed Bruce down the winding halls. Eventually he opened a door and stepped inside a massive bedroom so big that it made Edward's head spin. It had posters and was fully decorated in things Bruce enjoyed. Bruce set his bag down and turned to Edward.</p>

<p>"Lets find you a room."</p>

<p>Edward froze, then glared softly at him. "I know this place has probably hundreds of rooms but that is such a weird statement." He sighed softly. "I don't want a room here. One of your fancy couches in the living room we passed will be fine." Bruce gave him an odd look before shaking his head. "You will hurt Alfred's feelings if you do that. He keeps every room clean, it would make him happy to have one used. We rarely get guests."</p>

<p>Edward sighed and looked at the floor. "Ok, damn, no need to guilt me into it." Bruce walked over to Edward and pulled him into a light hug. "Will you tell me what makes you uncomfortable here? I didn't bring you to show off wealth. I brought you because I want to spend Christmas with you and to not have you alone in our dorm."</p>

<p>He didn't know how to respond except by leaning into the hold and closing his eyes. Right.. Bruce was still Bruce even if the environment changed, and one day they would be adults with their own lives as well. Edward pulled away from the hug and scratched his nose to try and distract himself a bit. "Fine, but you pick the room."</p>

<p>Bruce stared at Edward for a moment, trying to figure out what he could be thinking. "Don't complain then."</p>

<p>It was only a short walk, and Bruce had to push Edward through the door to enter the room he would be temporarily using for the week. "This--" Edward shook his head. "No. It's not a room. This is a fucking living room." Edward turned around, but Bruce was blocking the exit with his arms crossed. "Ed, this is a guest room. They are all like this. I'm sorry it's not what you're used to, but I want to give you the best, not the worst."</p>

<p>Edward took off his bag and walked inside the room. He set it on a fancy looking table, then touched the bed. "Are you serious? Bruce, this is polar opposite. I grew up in rooms smaller than our dorm and shared them with at least five other kids." He turned around to look him in the eyes. "And you easily call this a guest room?"</p>

<p>Bruce pushed off the door frame and walked over to him. "Is it now that you're here and can visualize it that you hate who I am?" Bruce questioned. Edward cast his gaze down to the floor, clearly conflicted. This <i>was</i> still Bruce, but having him here, being in this place.. It was surreal.</p>

<p>"Selina would turn this place into a cat heaven if she could." Edward mumbled with a small smile. "Alfred would never let her." Bruce retorted, sitting beside him on the bed and patting it. Edward joined him and sighed.</p>

<p>"It's.. a lot to take in. It's not every day your best friend invites you to their mansion to sleep over for a week." Edward laid down and stared at the ceiling, hands clasped together on his stomach. Bruce stayed sitting, unsure what to really do.</p>

<p>Edward looked at the back of his head and gently kicked him with his leg. "I know why you invited me, and it isn't just because you'd feel bad I was going to be alone." Bruce looked back at him and gave him a curious expression. "You were essentially going to be alone as well."</p>

<p>"I can't hide anything from you, can I?" Bruce cracked a small smile. 'I talked to Selina if she thought there was a small possibility Edward could love me.' Bruce stared at Edward's face as he watched the mans gaze take in the room. 'She said 'Fuck that, just go for it and stop overthinking it'..'</p>

<p>He couldn't help but stare at his lips. What would it be like to kiss him right now, or when he is in the middle of rambling about something? Bruce had imagined this many times over by now, but it was far worse today. For once he and Edward would be practically alone for an entire week. 'If any time is good, then I should tell him how I feel during this week.'</p>

<p>Edward made a face which caused Bruce to look at what made him grimace. "Oh, that." Edward sat up and pushed off the bed, not even looking at Bruce as he spoke. "You have your own bathroom."</p>

<p>"Shut the fuck up.. Seriously?" Edward flicked on the light and stared at the perfectly polished marble and clean floors. The shower could comfortably hold three people, and the bathtub was like a mini hot tub. Edward turned around and gave Bruce this look he couldn't place. "How the hell did you come from this and willingly move into that dorm? We hardly get hot water!"</p>

<p>Bruce sighed softly from his nose and shook his head. "Just because I am privileged like this doesn't mean I don't know dirt and grime." He then got a bright idea and took Edward's hand. "I just realized, I don't think I ever told you about my bike."</p>

<p>Edward had never seen Bruce look this ecstatic before. "Your bike?" He pressed for more details as he followed Bruce, not daring to pull back his hand. "Mhm." Bruce pulled him gently through the halls until they reached another garage (which shouldn't have surprised Edward as much as it did).</p>

<p>"I ride motorcycles. For obvious reasons, I brought my car rather than it to college." Bruce let go of his hand when they got inside and he pulled a cover off to reveal a brand new looking motorcycle. Edward had next to no idea about brands, parts, how to care for, terms, and anything else related to this topic.</p>

<p>Despite that he listened and watched Bruce with full interest as he rambled about rides, how he cared for the motorcycle, and the races he took part in. Bruce then went into a tangent about the fight he and Alfred had when he bought it, that this would be Bruce's responsibility through and through, and that he wouldn't help at all with it.</p>

<p>Edward could tell this wasn't just a hobby, it was a passion. He loved watching Bruce throughly explain everything, and while he rarely expressed his emotions he could see the glint in his eyes. Edward did not dare touch the bike, just admired it from a safe distance.</p>

<p>"Sorry if I bored you to death," Bruce said while fixing up his helmet. "I don't have anyone to talk to about this."</p>

<p>Edward was half standing half sitting on a table, so he was mildly comfortable. But bored? Not at all. "If this was boring I would have fallen asleep." He motioned towards the bike. "That's your prized possession and interest. Of course I am invested in it as well. Plus you rarely talk about yourself, so this is fun."</p>

<p>For once, Edward noticed how Bruce's face seemed to flush a light pink. It was hard to ignore that. 'Do I really want to risk things being awkward between us just to tell him I fancy him?' He squeaked when Bruce had walked in front of him without realizing. "Would you like to go for a ride one day this week?"</p>

<p>Edward opened his mouth but nothing came out. He had no idea why he was so nervous right now. Edward inhaled slowly to regulate himself before nodding. If words failed, use other methods.</p>

<p>After that they decided to go back upstairs to relax and, in Bruce's words, make Edward feel at home. It was hard to feel that way when "home" was a mansion worth more than hundreds of peoples paychecks a year. They settled on relaxing on a couch together. Edward had brought his laptop and was using it while Bruce laid beside him on his phone.</p>

<p>It was nice to relax with someone and do your own thing; together but separate.</p>

<p>Alfred came into the room later and cleared his throat to get their attention. "Bruce, would I be able to discuss something with you alone?" Bruce looked at Edward who casually shrugged, clearly not minding. He got up and followed Alfred into the next room to see what was going on.</p>

<p>"When were you going to inform me that you were dating someone?" Always blunt and straight to the point. Bruce crossed his arms and kept a neural face. "We are currently friends."</p>

<p>Alfred made that face again, the one where he knew the answer, that he thought Bruce was lying to him. "Really? You have yet to even bring Selina here and she has been friends with you for more than a decade. Not only that, you are quite close to him and he is the same."</p>

<p>Bruce rubbed his face, trying to fight back the annoyance he had bubbling under the surface. Of course Alfred would be interested and even press this manner. It was his doing, so he couldn't blame Alfred. "I do like him, yes. Do not give me any love speeches-"</p>

<p>"I wasn't. What I <i>was</i> going to say was that you just met him. This is too fast. It has not even been six months yet." Alfred looked a bit softer, Bruce noticed this. Perhaps he was happy that his surrogate son was finally branching out? Who knew what went on in that head.</p>

<p>"You act like I haven't realized that myself." Bruce realized what this was. Alfred wanted him to fight for his approval, or to defend why he loved Edward. "You can interact with him yourself to understand why I came to the conclusion I did."</p>

<p>"I'd rather hear it from your own mouth." Alfred said with a low tone as if daring Bruce to talk back. Bruce never won against him. "He does not care about my status, or uses me for money. Somehow, someway, he is always there for me even when he doesn't realize. There's.. too many small things to list, but I hope you can listen to my judgement to form your own."</p>

<p>Bruce made a move to leave, but paused when he felt a hand on his shoulder. "I just want you to be sure of your decisions. If he rejects you or leaves it will hurt." Alfred said very quietly, almost like he didn't want the truth to hurt him.</p>

<p>"Life is painful, but being able to open up yourself to others is worth the risk.." He turned around and hugged Alfred for a moment. "Thank you." Bruce let go and gave him a small smile before turning to return to Edward. "Wait, don't leave empty handed." Alfred handed him two cups of hot chocolate. "Dinner will be done in an hour."</p>

<p>Bruce held them carefully, wondering why Alfred didn't just bring these in when he asked for Bruce. Then it clicked. They both wanted Edward to feel at home, and a butler tending to them would do the opposite of that. "Thanks." Bruce saw Alfred nod, and his throat clammed up. "Alfred--" He swallowed down his emotions.</p>

<p>"How do I tell if someone is in love with me?"</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Edward was having a hard time falling asleep. He had a nice day with Bruce all things considered. The drive her, the bike talk, hanging out in the living room with hot chocolate until dinner, then watching a movie before they decided it was late.</p>

<p>The issue is Edward was not comfortable enough to sleep right now. This room was too big, too expensive, and just.. <i>too much</i>. The bed was warm and comfortable, but somehow his body wouldn't relax enough to be able to drift off.</p>

<p>Damnit this was going to be a hard week.</p>

<p>Edward grabbed his phone and tried to doom scroll through a random social media to see if that would get him tired. After half an hour, he was more awake than ever.</p>

<p>Fuck it.</p>

<p>Edward got up and put on the sweatshirt Bruce gifted him. He opened the door and looked down the hall. The silence and atmosphere felt suffocating. He did not belong here, yet here he was. He walked down the hall, past the living room, and into one he spotted earlier. When Bruce had showed him to his room he remembered passing a library of sorts.</p>

<p>Luckily the door wasn't locked. Without fail, books were his comfort. This was not his home, so not only did he know what was stored he felt horrible for touching without asking.</p>

<p>If it didn't leave the room or get harmed, it should be fine, right?</p>

<p>Edward entered the library and felt around for a light switch. He flicked it on and began to scan the walls of books. His younger self would have exploded with excitement seeing all of these. While he still loved to read, it was not his all time favorite activity like it was when he was a kid.</p>

<p>Books took him away from reality and put his mind somewhere safe.</p>

<p>He picked one that seemed interesting and looked around for somewhere to sit. Couches, office chairs, and hell even a bar stool were in here. What really caught his eye was the bean bag, though. It was massive, comfortable enough for two adults to use, so that would do. He clambered onto it and settled down before opening the book up and letting his mind wander.</p>

<p>About halfway through the book he heard a noise and looked up. Edward locked eyes with Bruce, who had just entered the library and looked a bit concerned. That melted when they locked eyes, though. Bruce was in a very old and worn sweatshirt and some pj pants. He walked over and sat on the other side of the beanbag.</p>

<p>"I couldn't really sleep so I texted you. When I got no response I thought you were asleep and went to go do something and saw your door open." Bruce held a neutral expression now, but Edward knew he had panicked even if momentarily.</p>

<p>"Apologies. I just.. Couldn't sleep. Even now I'm not really tired." He confessed, looking away from Bruce.</p>

<p>"Neither can I." Bruce got up from the bean bag and offered his hand to Edward. "I have an idea of what we can do." Edward looked at his hand curiously. He memorized the page he was on before shutting it and setting it aside, then took his hand and stood up. "And that idea is?"</p>

<p>Bruce did not let go and guided Edward back to his room. "Get dressed warmly. I'm going to take you riding to my favorite spot." Edward wanted to complain. It was damn near two am, cold as hell, and he did not want to get out. But he could see this look in Bruce's eyes that saying no to would be impossible. "Alright."</p>

<p>Edward put on his warmest attire and grabbed his phone to see it was 2:05 am and snowing. Great. He waited in the hall for Bruce and choked on air when he finally stepped out. Bruce was in full bike gear made for this type of cold windy weather.</p>

<p>And he looked <i>hot</i>.</p>

<p>Edward could not help but blush.</p>

<p>He followed Bruce to the garage, then watched as he turned the bike on to get it warmed up. While the motorcycle purred loudly, Bruce grabbed a helmet and handed it to Edward. "Do you need help putting it on?"</p>

<p>Edward hated how his heart sped up. "No." Edward took it and stared at it. "What about my glasses?" He questioned.</p>

<p>"I can keep them safe for the ride. It is just a four minute drive from here." Bruce stood in front of him and gave him a look of 'may i?' Edward looked uneasy, but slowly nodded. He reached out and carefully took his glasses off and pocketed them up safely.</p>

<p>Edward hated how blurry the world was without them, he felt helpless. He put on the helmet and buckled it, then tried to look around. Not only was it blurry, but with the visor it was dark. Bruce gently grabbed his hand and guided him to the bike. He got on first, then helped Edward on. "Hold onto my middle."</p>

<p>Edward obeyed instantly, locking his arms around him. Bruce put on his own helmet and turned the kickstand. "Ready?" He squeezed his middle as a yes. "Once we get going the wind will make it impossible to hear, so if you get scared just squeeze me twice." Edward felt the balance of the bike shift as they pulled out of the garage, then the bitter coldness.</p><div class="gray">
  <div class="white">
    <div class="bggif-container">

<p>The ride was truly terrifying at first. Cold, windy, and uneasy. He couldn't see, and when he did try to look he just saw a blur of snow whisking by as Bruce steadily picked up speed. </p>

<p>It did not take him long to realize just how nice this moment was. He was going to murder his heart for betraying him like this. Surely Bruce could feel it threatening to escape his chest, couldn't he?</p>

<p>True to his word, the drive itself was not that long. He could feel Bruce slow the bike down before nudging the kickstand down and turning it off.</p>

<p>Edward got off the bike, but wobbled due to his legs vibrating from the motorcycles engine that entire time. He felt Bruce hold him just in case he fell. 'I truly am fucked.'</p>

<p>He took off his own helmet and squinted around, trying to figure out where they were. All he saw was a blurry blob of white and some scenery.</p>

<p>"Here." Bruce handed him his glasses and set his helmet on the now silent bike. Edward took them and slid them on.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was the snow.</p>

<p>It was a light down poor, not obstructing the view but ever so present. It coated everything from the trees, grass, and buildings. The doom and gloom of the city vanished under the soft white powder. Edward didn't know where they were in the city, but it was stunning.</p>

<p>He walked towards the railing, his shoes crunching the undisturbed snow below him, and leaned against it. The moon was a tiny sliver and while he could hardly see any stars, the view seemed so.. real.</p>

<p>Bruce walked up beside him and stared at the blank night sky. "One of the most horrible thing about a city is light pollution."</p>

<p>Edward moved his eyes to look at Bruce, then back to the sky where he saw a plane overhead. "I've never seen more than five stars in the sky." He admitted. "But I've seen what it looks like in images."</p>

<p>Bruce looked down at Edward since he was leaned against the railing. Snow was collecting in his hair and glasses. He could see how his cheeks, nose, and ears were pink due to the cold temperature, and that every breath he took became a fog in the crisp air.</p>

<p>"I want to take you somewhere to see the stars one day." Bruce blurted out without thinking. Edward pushed up against the metal and stared at him with a warm grin.</p>

<p>"Is that a promise?' Edward reached up and gently brushed some snow from Bruce's hair. "I'll hold you to it, then."</p>

<p>There was something about this moment Bruce couldn't place. It felt truly perfect, like all the pieces came together. He could see how tender Edward was being, the tone of his voice, and how they looked at one another.</p>

<p>Alfred's advice truly was helping in this moment.</p>

<p>
  <i>"If you see the way you look at him, how do you think he looks at you?"</i>
</p>

<p>Bruce stared into Edward's eyes, then reached up and cupped the back of his neck. Edward looked surprised, but curious. He wasn't pulling away. He was looking at him like he expected something to happen. There was no denying they were thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>He pulled Edward towards him and kissed him softly. Edward made a noise and tensed up, but the hand in Bruce's hair didn't move to push him away. It trailed down to mimic Bruce's; holding his neck and keeping him there.</p>

<p>Bruce held Edward with his other arm, pulling him closer to deepen the kiss. Edward made another small noise when their faces smushed, making his glasses poke into them. Bruce couldn't help but smile against his lips.</p>

<p>Edward pulled back just a millimeter away, his eyes darting between Bruce's rapidly. He was searching for any negative reaction like regret, disgust, or rejection. Bruce moved his hand to cup Edward's cheek and he rubbed it softly. "I wouldn't have kissed you if I wasn't sure of how I felt."</p>

<p>Edward blinked, looking momentarily confused. His brain was short circuiting, then seemed to finally connect the wires. "Liar." He huffed. "You wouldn't have kissed me unless you were sure of how <i>I</i> felt. What gave it away?" He leaned into Bruce's hand but his gaze never left his eyes.</p>

<p>"You hid it well." Bruce said, but he knew if Selina was here she'd argue it was the opposite. "Maybe I took a shot in the dark."</p>

<p>Edward leaned forward and kissed him again, this time a bit more mindful of his glasses. He rubbed the back of Bruce's neck with one hand while the other held his side.</p>

<p>Not even the snow could get between them right now.</p>

<p>"You know I was <i>this</i> close to kissing you, too." Edward said when he pulled away to breathe, their noses touching. Being this close he could see all of the intricate details of Bruce's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you were, hm?" Bruce playfully teased him and kissed his cheek. "Guess I'll never know for sure, now will I?"</p>

<p>"You're such an ass." Edward snorted and turned his head to rest his forehead against his shoulder. He moved his hand to grab Bruce's wrist and guide it to his chest. "You're an evil bastard for making my heart pump like this. It feels like I'm running on air."</p>

<p>Bruce nuzzled into the side of Edward's head and focused on feeling his heart. "I'd guess.. 108 BPM?"</p>

<p>This got a chuckle from Edward who shook his head, subtly nuzzling closer to his neck. "I'm going to kill you." He joked, not serious at all.</p>

<p>"But then how will you date a corpse?" Bruce felt the silence come right after. It wasn't bad, it was just the both of them realizing at the same time that they hadn't even talked about if they were even dating, yet it was crystal clear.</p>

<p>Edward put a hand over Bruce's mouth before he could speak. "No way in hell I'm letting you beat me to that question." He slowly removed his hand, but cupped his face instead. "Bruce, will you be my boyfriend?"</p>

<p>Bruce saw the flash of anxiety in his eyes. The fear. He saw embarrassment next, then Edward turned his face and seemed angry. "God that came out so cringe-"</p>

<p>Before Edward could spiral into a panic, Bruce grabbed his head and kissed him hard. This time he moved his lips and watched Edward's eyes slip closed as the stress melted away. This time neither of them pulled away from the kiss. Bruce panted lightly against his lips and watched their breaths mingle in the cold air.</p>

<p>"S.. so," Edward wet his lips. "Is that a yes?"</p>

<p>God he was an idiot. "I guess I have to kiss you again but better to get it through to you what my answer is." Bruce pushed Edward against the railing to hold him there. He grabbed his face and kissed him deeper, locking their lips together. Anytime he felt Edward need to breathe he would gently bite his bottom lip and watch him pant.</p>

<p>Edward's mind was spinning, he felt so dizzy yet so <i>alive</i>. He couldn't look away from Bruce or his gaze like they were the only two things to exist here and now. Truthfully, he was captivated beyond measure. "You're a drug."</p>

<p>Bruce tilted his head a bit and paused to gently nibble on one of his lips. He tugged it before letting go and pecking him. "Because I'm addicting?" He guessed. Edward nodded and swallowed hard. "Yeah, but also because I feel like I could overdose on you."</p>

<p>"Is that a compliment?" Bruce nuzzled Edward softly. He moved his hands down to intertwine their fingers. 'He isn't wearing gloves, but I am. I should have realized.' He looked over Edward and noted he was getting rather cold.</p>

<p>"Of course it is." Edward stretched up and kissed him again, smirking as if he won a game against Selina. Bruce let him have his small win of kissing last. "Lets head back and warm up."</p>

<p>Edward didn't need to respond to know he was in agreement.</p>

<p>Somehow, the drive back felt slower. Edward wasn't as tense when holding Bruce, but he couldn't ignore the shivering.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When they arrived Bruce took Edward's helmet off for him and glanced at his lips. He'd have to wait a minute or more for that. Edward reached out and took Bruce's hand, squeezing it softly. He guided them back to his own room.</p>

<p>Edward didn't protest when Bruce practically pulled him into his bed. He pulled the covers around them as Edward curled up beside him, shivering harder as the cold settled into his body. Bruce wrapped an arm around him and nuzzled the top of his head.</p>

<p>"is.." Edward spoke up, but his voice wavered due to nervousness. "Is this alright? You.. dating someone like me?"</p>

<p>Bruce moved just enough to look him in the eyes. He took his glasses off and set them aside, then cupped his head with both hands. "Someone like you is exactly what I want. I should be asking you that question."</p>

<p>"What? Why?" Edward sounded surprised. "You're genuinely sweet and amazing- how could I not love you?"</p>

<p>Bruce gave him a knowing look. "It's the same with you. How can I not love you? Why are you shocked about this?" He thumbed his cheek softly. "Ed, stop worrying about this." Bruce locked eyes with him, showing him how serious he was about this. "I love you."</p>

<p>Edward's breath hitched, then he let out a strangled noise. It was hard to not worry, to not ask Bruce if he was sure a million times over. "I love you, too." He nuzzled into one of his hands and closed his eyes. "I've never dated anyone before."</p>

<p>Bruce laid down and pulled Edward close to him. "It's like how we are already, just include kisses and sharing a bed."</p>

<p>Edward finally yawned and wrapped an arm around Bruce's middle, not daring to let him go. "I thought.. I was just going to go through college quietly and get a stupid job and just.. exist." He buried his head into the pillow and mumbled something Bruce could't hear. He reached up and lazily pet his slightly damp hair from melted snowflakes that got trapped there.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Bruce said, snuggling down closer to Edward as he felt exhaustion just behind his eyelids. "We can blame Selina for this."</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Edward woke up first. He opened his eyes to see Bruce's just an inch away. He reached up and gently ran his thumb across his cheek. 'Was last night real?'</p>

<p>Here he was in Bruce's bed, their legs tangled in one another, and the proof in his hands.</p>

<p>He couldn't help himself and kissed his forehead softly. Edward felt oddly protective. To try to keep bruce safe and asleep in this moment. He pulled the blanket closer and settled with holding him against his chest.</p>

<p>That's how Bruce woke up: To Edward's heartbeat. He opened his eyes and slowly processed that Edward was laying down but holding him close. It made his own heart swell with love. He stretched slow and looked up at Edward, smiling softly when they locked eyes.</p>

<p>Edward lazily pet Bruce's hair and returned the smile. "Morning." When Bruce tried to sit up Edward stopped him. He pulled the blanket up more and went back to petting his hair. "We aren't in a rush to wake up, are we?" Bruce shook his head and melted into Edward's touch, fully content in this moment.</p><center>

<p class="message-text">We arrived to his place, I met Alfred which was nerve wracking at first but he is quite nice. Bruce showed me his motorcycle, then we hung out for a while. I couldn't sleep and apparently neither could he, so he took me bike riding in the snow. It was an experience, and incredibly beautiful. He made the first move and we kissed, but I was the one to confirm we were dating. Then we went home and cuddled till we passed out, and now today where we informed you both.</p></div>
