<p>This letter was the culmination of his effort since he started studying as a child. He had put his entire existence into getting out of the orphanage and having a normal life. He would have an apartment and work at a 9-5 monday through friday until he could retire with some savings. Just an average life was all he wished for.</p>

<p>He shared and lived in a room with at least five other rowdy kids until he <s>was kicked out</s> left that wretched place. He went from job to job saving every penny he could to buy his <i>own</i> laptop. With that he could finally start his real challenge: college. If he wanted a decent job in this day and age and to keep it for decades he would need that piece of paper saying he graduated.</p>

<p>He had been incredibly lucky to getting a few scholorships that paid for a majority of his tuition. Now that he was in though all that was left was time. Studying, grades, projects, all of that he could do without complaint. He had mastered the skill of being invisible and staying in the background out of trouble.</p>

<p>That's what he thought at least.</p>

<p>Edward ran into some.. <i>problems</i> in his first semester. College still required some basic classes, so he had to be in lecture rooms with dozens of idiots all trying to pass a math course. Numbers came easy to him, just fundamental rules where variables could be altered.</p>

<p>Maybe he sat in the wrong place (middle left of the massive room), or perhaps it was because he didn't try to hide his tests the second he got them. Whatever the case may be, life was playing a cruel prank on him when he began to catch someones eye. It was subtle at first but Edward could feel them staring. He made his last mistake that sealed his fate: glancing back.</p>

<p>He saw a nonchalant looking girl staring right at him. A grin spread across her face when Edward finally acknowledged her presence. She was just two seats over with an empty one in between them. His last buffer. Class was still going on and Edward was doing his damn best to keep his attention glued to his notes.</p>

<p>She scooted over one seat and dragged her purse with her, no note paper or anything. He was fucked now.</p>

<p>"Hey," The woman started, speaking quietly. "Sorry to bother ya, but I was wondering if you could give me a hand? Some of this stuff is a bit confusin' but you seem to get it."</p>

<p>Edward glanced at her again. He was hunched a bit over the table so was just a bit shorter than her. Edward gripped his pencil and closed his eyes for a moment. "You can look at my notes if you want, I don't care."</p>

<p>A warmer smile spread across her face and she rested her head on her hand, eyes never leaving him. "Nah I mean tutor. I got the money if you have the time."</p>

<p>..money? That wasn't a bad idea, actually. He <i>could</i> tutor for a price.. He'd have to research good prices though. The only issue was interacting with people, which he really wanted to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>"I can see what you are," She said vaguly, sitting back in her chair. "Loner who wants to quietly get through college and get a boring but comfortable job." That smile was gone, replaced with a calm and neutral emotion. Edward looked back at his notes and huffed slightly. "Do you want to be tutored or judge me?"</p>

<p>"Sorry. Wasn't my place to." She took out a pen and wrote on the corner of his page:</p>

<p>
  <span class="font-hand">Selina 999-111-2222<span class="vanish">000000</span></span>
</p>

<p>After that she, Selina he assumed, did not speak or bother him again. It was hard to fully concentrate on the teachers lecture the rest of class. When it was over 45 minutes later Edward packed up and tried to dip as soon as possible. He could feel Selina's eyes on him the entire time and <i>knew</i> she wanted to speak to him again.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>This was going to bother him all day. He turned to her with a slightly annoyed expression. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Damn you got an attitude." She snorted a bit, amused. "I wanted to know your name."</p>

<p>Edward was taken aback, but it made sense. Formalities, especially if he was going to go through with this and teach her for some cash. "Edward." He glanced away. "I will contact you later."</p>

<p>Selina watched Edward leave with the rest of the class but stayed behind. He was an odd ball for sure. She had met her fair share of people ranging from shy to an asshole, but Edward was neither of these. Sure he came off as rude but even she could tell it was due to being on guard. She got up and fixed her purse before turning to the person sitting two seats away.</p>

<p>"Come on Bruce I talked to him for you. If you want me to keep seeing if he's a good person you better send some money to my bank account."</p>

<p>Selina had been sitting beside Bruce originally, but moved to talk to Edward. Bruce got up and slung his backpack over his shoulder. "You did <i>not</i> have to do that."</p>

<p>"Awe come on," Selina teased as they walked to go grab some lunch, elbowing Bruce. "When you said you found the guy sitting beside me cute I <i>had</i> to go see what he is like. You never take interest in anyone! This is a monumental moment. Should I print it and hang it on the fridge?"</p>

<p>Bruce rolled his eyes and grumbled something out. Selina chuckled a bit. "Well if you want me to keep seeing if he could be our friend I expect <i>some</i> financial compensation."</p>

<p>"Just from one short conversation you really want to bother yourself to see if, what, we are compatible? Don't worry about it. I can't say anything around you I swear.." Bruce walked up to a door and held it open for Selina and another stranger walking by. He quickly caught up to her.</p>

<p>"Nah Brucie," Selina smirked. "I've never seen you like <i>this</i>! In any party, get together, bar or club."</p>

<p>"That's because you drag me there." He huffed out as they entered the main building where a few types of fast food were. The lines were already quite long due to many classes getting out at the same time near lunch. "Oh, oh, I'm feeling Panda Express." Selina grabbed his arm and pulled him into the long line there. "And shut up you like being at parties sometimes."</p>

<p>Bruce pulled out his phone and mindlessly scrolled on it to try to ignore Selina. He really wished she would drop the topic. They had gotten to class on time and had to squeeze past Edward, as he obviously overheard his and Selina's conversation. The guy had clear framed glasses, bright green eyes, and a look of determination on his face he had not seen on anyone before.</p>

<p>Selina had seen him practically staring and he had told her he found him cute. That was his mistake. He shouldn't have said anything, really. Now she had butted in just to judge what type of person Bruce had been interested in.</p>

<p>Bruce hovered over the send button, then sighed. He clicked it, transferring Selina 50$.</p>

<p>She had clearly been watching and smirked. "I knew it." "Oh shut the hell up." He stared straight ahead refusing to look her in the eye. "You liked his sassy personality~" "Selina shut up." Bruce nudged her a bit. "Is that your type? Tall, nerdy, and cu--"</p>

<p>Bruce put a hand over her mouth and gave her a serious stare. He motioned with his eyes and Selina looked to what he was trying to show her.</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>
  <i>Oh.</i>
</p>

<p>Edward was ordering food as they spoke, just a foot or two away. She licked Bruce's palm which made him remove it quickly. Edward both stuck out like a sore thumb and mingled in with the crowd expertly at the same time. If she had not given him another thought as a stranger she was sure he wouldn't exist in her mind. But due to being aware of him he was like a tower. Taller than most people, giving off a vibe that others don't (akin to "i dont exist, dont look at me" Selina would guess), and his attire. Older worn clothes, clearly well taken care of.</p>

<p>Selina looked at Bruce to see he <i>was</i> staring at Edward. Namely, his backpack. She looked and saw a few pins and charms on it that showed a bit of what his likes could be. She didn't recognize any, but she'd just bother Bruce about it later.</p>

<p>Edward ordered a bowl of fried rice and orange chicken, paid, and left, vanishing into the crowd rather quickly. Selina nudged Bruce. "Sooo?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to kill you. What if he overheard us?" "Oh chill. He's the type of guy to be invisible, so he wouldn't bother to listen into our conversation. Even if he did we didn't say his name so theres no connection. Stop being a worry wart." She got her food first then waited on Bruce. "Lets try to find him and-"</p>

<p>"Selina you're taking this too far." Bruce spoke low and calm but he was deadly serious. "All I said was he looked cute and now you're going overboard with this."</p>

<p>Selina paused, then slumped a bit. "Sorry. It isn't every day you see your best friend finally looks interested in something, alright?" They sat at a random table and pulled out their food. "I saw this look in your eyes I've never seen before."</p>

<p>Bruce was about to take a bite but paused. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You passed by him first and did a damn double take like in the movies then wouldn't move for me to take my seat." Selina ate a bite then waved her fork as she spoke after she swallowed. "I was apparently blocking your view and you could not focus on class. Of course I had to do something."</p>

<p>Bruce could feel his cheeks heat up a bit. "I see." They ate in silence for a minute or two before Bruce broke the silence. "You normally don't give a shit about other people."</p>

<p>"He's like me." Selina said vaguely, offering no followup.</p>

<p>Bruce gave her a weird look. He trusted her, of course he did as they've been friends since middle school, but he wished she'd sometimes just be clear. Well, if Selina seemed to like Edward then he must be a good guy. Her intuition was always correct without fail. All he had to do was wait and see what Selina would tell him about this guy.</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Tutoring shouldn't be hard, especially math. He was great at math. What he wasn't good at was talking to people and interacting with them, especially one on one. He had texted Selina first (he had to, he wants the money), and god it felt so awkward. She seemed chill and nice though. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as he thought?</p><div class="container">

  <div class="chat-box">

<p class="reply">Hello. Is this Selina?</p>

<p class="text">yep. edward?</p>

<p class="reply">Yes. I wanted to take up your offer on being your tutor. How much do you think is reasonable?</p>

<p class="text">25 an hour sound good?</p>

<p class="reply">See you then.</p></div>

<p>Waiting was a horrible feeling. Luckily Selina was not late. He got right into explaining what she was struggling with and doing his best to teach her what he easily understood. Suspiciously, she was grasping onto these concepts without a problem. 'She is smarter than she lets on.' Edward thought to himself. She wasn't stupid, he knew that the second they met, but seeing this..</p>

<p>She seemed bored and more like she was analyzing him rather than the math problems. It unnerved him.</p>

<p>When Selina answered the next problem without issue Edward sat up and crossed his arms. "Why are you really here?"</p>

<p>"To learn math, duh." She rolled her eyes. Edward's eyebrows furred. "Really? The problem I gave you is three chapters ahead of the lecture and you solved it with me showing you it twice. Either you are a prodigy or you don't actually need to be tutored. So why are you <i>really</i> here?"</p>

<p>Selina sat back in the chair and sighed softly. "Damn you catch on fast.." Edward shook his head. "No you just made it obvious you were here for other reasons." She smirked and tapped her arm, thinking for a moment. "Well, you are interesting for sure." Selina leaned in a bit. "You're a guy without friends, right? I want to be your friend."</p>

<p>Edward snorted, then chuckled. "Seriously? That's not why you're here. You're being too.. weird. This whole situation is. I don't want friends." Edward grabbed his notebook and closed it. He was going to leave.</p>

<p>"You don't want friends, or you can't <i>get</i> friends." Selina rolled her eyes. "You looked like a cool dude alright?"</p>

<p>"I have a feeling you want to just cheat off me.." Edward paused. "But you don't need to." He then froze for a moment. So why <b>was</b> she here? It coudn't be to make friends. No one pays for a tutor they dont need to make friends. There was something else here and honestly he wanted to know, but that seemed like he was geting into new and dangerous territory.</p>

<p>"Stop overthinking. It isn't that deep." Selina huffed and set her hand on his notebook before he could put it in his backpack. "You.. just remind me of me." She sighed softly. "I used to be alone by choice and I never knew how bad it sucked. Thrifting isn't a hobby or something people in need do for fun."</p>

<p>Edward stared at her hand, then up to lock eyes with her. Oh. He recognized this emotion. He saw it in the mirror often. The struggle and fight to survive while life beats you down, dealt an unfair hand, and the climb to a better life. Edward looked at her clothes. They had to be at least five years old and had many skillful stitches.</p>

<p>He realized it now. She had seen herself in him and wanted to help. Edward looked away and down at the ground. "i'm surviving. I don't need help."</p>

<p>"Hun." Selina let go of the notebook and moved her chair to sit beside Edward. "Help comes in all forms, even if its someone just being there for you. Stop isolating yourself just to keep yourself safe. It isn't healthy."</p>

<p>Edward grit his teeth and put the notebook in his backpack. "So you paid me 25$ out of pity?"</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that?" Selina said low, almost like a threat. Edward felt chills. He didn't think so, but what else was he supposed to assume? "Why do you give a shit about me really?"</p>

<p>Selina relaxed a bit and gently pat his shoulder. "Wouldn't you do the same?"</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>"So how'd it go?" Bruce asked Selina when she walked into their shared dorm. Selina set her purse on a table and smiled. "I think he and I are friends now."</p>

<p>Bruce's eyesbrows shot up in surprise. "Really? That soon? How?"</p>

<p>"I have my ways." Selina waved her hand. "If it all works out I think we will be a good triangle of friends." She paused. "Or I'll become the third wheel.."</p>

<p>Bruce threw a pillow at her. "He doesn't know I even exist and you're saying this?"</p>

<p>Selina caught the pillow and whacked him with it, smirking. "Yep. My gaydar is going off the charts." Bruce rolled his eyes at Selina's comment. "That doesn't mean we will be a thing. No one will ever replace you."</p>

<p>"Awe that's sweet. I'll place you at number one and bump Anika down to two for that."</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Selina was a mastermind. She knew Bruce would never talk to Edward alone if she had not stepped in, and getting to know the guy now it would be a trillion years before he would have ever even considered looking at someone else let alone say hi to them. She could see these two idiots would be friends if they tried, but getting them to interact would take a more than an act of God.</p>

<p>Luckily she was atheist. She didn't need outside assistance with this. Plus it was two weeks since they met, so she was sure it was time for something to happen.</p><div class="container">

<p>She could tell throughout each conversation they had Edward and her were getting closer as friends. It was clear he was attempting to push his own boundaries and comfort to try new waters, and really she didn't want to overwhelm him.</p>

<p>"Bruce," Selina rolled over from the couch to look at the other who was in sweats tapping away on a laptop. "Ed's coming over can you order us pizza."</p>

<p>He sat up and looked at her with confusion. "Seriously?" "Yeah, oh and get me pineapple." "You're diabolical."</p>

<p>It only took Edward half an hour to show up and tentatively knock on the door. Selina opened it wearing casual, almost PJ like clothes. Edward was in an old faded green sweatshirt and jeans ripped at the knees. "Uh, hi."</p>

<p>"Stop bein' awkward and get inside." Selina gently pulled him in and shut the door behind him. It was a small enough place. Basically a living room, kitchen, and two beds. "Life of luxury here, huh?" She nudged him playfully.</p>

<p>Edward looked around, clearly searching for the roommate. "He left to go pick up the pizza. Cheaper to get it yourself than delivery."</p>

<p>"How much do I owe?" Edward looked at her, hands fidgeting in the sweatshirt pocket.</p>

<p>"Housewarming gift for showing up. Or if you want to pay up, you can help me with my essay." Selina smirked.</p>

<p>"Oh shut up." Edward rolled his eyes, his shoulders sagging a bit as he got a bit more comfortable in this unfamiliar place. Selina sat on the couch and pat it to indicate to Edward he should sit. 'As someone who rarely if ever hangs out with people I bet he isn't going to be the best at talking or knowing what to do. That's fine.'</p>

<p>"How do you already have the essay almost done?" Selina stretched her legs before sitting criss cross on the couch. "Huh? Oh, uh, I have a lot of free time when I am not working." Edward mumbled, a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>"We haven't talked about your job. Want to?" She pressed him for details, eager to learn more about him.</p>

<p>"Eh, it's nothing interesting really. I work at the college for now to get some scholorships to pay for things. Assisting people in printing stuff." He shrugged. "What about you?"</p>

<p>"I do not wanna get into that," Selina half whined and leaned back into the couch. "Then tell me about your cats?" Edward suggested.</p>

<p>Selina went into a nearly half an hour tangent about the strays on and near the campus, then past strays she cared for. Despite the topic being unconventional to most Edward paid attention the entire time and nodded along or asked questions when a break in the conversation occurred.</p>

<p>"Wait, so Sam just randomly scratched Piper?" Edward's brows furred. "i don't know a lot about cats but that seems mean."</p>

<p>"Eh, not really. Cats do that and other random shit often." Selina waved her hand. "It's very normal for them."</p>

<p>The door opened and the smell of pizza filled the air almost instantly. Selina waved to Bruce who was carrying two boxes and a bag of bread sticks. She smirked seeing how his eyes landed on Edward first rather than her. "Hey Brucie!"</p>

<p>Bruce sighed softly before nodding to Edward, a silent greeting. He set the boxes on the counter and opened one to grab two slices and a bread stick. Selina jumped off the couch and grabbed Bruce just before he could leave the room. "You're not uninvited to your own damn living space. Eat in here."</p>

<p>He glanced to Edward, then back to her. "I don't want to be a bother."</p>

<p>Edward stood up and fixed his sweatshirt out of nervousness. This guy.. something about him was interesting, but he couldn't place why. "it's fine. You went and got the pizza then paid for it." He opened the other box to see a half pineapple and half sausage pizza and took a slice.</p>

<p>Selina hummed. "No comment on the toppings?" Most people would say something about the pineapple. Edward looked at her as he took a bite of pizza and shrugged. "I told you I'm not picky."</p>

<p>Bruce finally decided to sit down and just eat his pizza while staring at anything but Edward. Selina had to make damn sure this did not start to feel awkward. "So, Eddie, this is Bruce. I've known this idiot since middle school."</p>

<p>Edward chewed a bite while listening and analyzing. 'That long? We just met, so I'm not a close friend.' He looked at Bruce again and they finally locked eyes. The pizza nearly slipped out of his hand as he realized <i>who</i> this person was.</p>

<p>"Are you Bruce Wayne?"</p>

<p>Bruce froze then tensed up and sighed. "Yeah."</p>

<p>Edward was baffled, safe to say. He expected Bruce Wayne to have his own room in the best building, or not even go to college since things were handed to him. Right? Right?? And this guy just freely got him pizza!</p>

<p>Edward turned to Selina and huffed. "If this is why you said I don't owe money for pizza then you're rude."</p>

<p>Selina blinked, then burst into laughter. "Holy shit! That is NOT a normal reaction to that revelation! I <i>knew</i> you would be a good friend."</p>

<p>Edward slowly took another bite, confused and suspicious. He looked to Bruce to see if he could figure more out. The other just shrugged and ate a breadstick, offering no answers.</p>

<p>God. Just who and the hell did he befriend. These two idiots were going to distract him from getting perfect grades, weren't they? Shit, he could see it now. Selina was definitely the type to make him hang out without a real excuse. Why did he both hate and like that?</p>

<p>Selina whacked Edward's back almost painfully. "Most folks who meet the GREAT Bruce Wayne start fawning over him. I knew you'd be cool about it."</p>

<p>"I see what this is now." Edward narrowed his eyes. "You didn't need a tutor. You wanted another friend in the friend group."</p>

<p>"Damn you read right through me. Yeah, that's right. After I got a girlfriend Bruce here is lonely-"</p>

<p>"I am not a surrogate." Edward glared softly at her. "Do you want to be a real friend or do you want to use me as a third?" His tone was low and deadly. Selina smiled warmly and removed her hand. "Everything I've said is true, Edward. It's just been me and Bruce for years until Anika came along, but I didn't find you to fill a hole from that outcome."</p>

<p>"Then why?" Edward glanced to Bruce, wondering if he knew. His expression was confusion, so he was most likely not privy to this. "I got a vibe from you." Selina shrugged. "That's about it."</p>

<p>"Fucking hell." Edward grabbed a breadstick and pointed it at her. "I am not letting you play with my emotions like a damn toy."</p>

<p>"You are taking this way out of proportion." Selina wagged her half eaten pizza at Edward. "Accept the fact someone wants to be a friend to you."</p>

<p>Edward cracked a smile, unable to keep whatever anger he had a moment ago. "Whatever." He pointed the breadstick again at her. "Not like you could hurt me anyway."</p>

<p>Selina leaned forward and took a bite from the breadstick and smugly chewed it. Edward looked so offended. "What the hell Selina?!"</p>

<p>Both of them looked over when Bruce began to laugh. He was covering his mouth and coughing back chuckles from these two. Edward just looked so damn adorable when he seemed genuinely hurt by his breadstick being eaten.</p>

<p>Edward blushed hard and angrily (as angrily as one could) took a bite of his remaining breadstick.</p>

<p>Seems they all got off on the right foot. This was good progress for a first meeting. "So Eddie," Selina had to start the conversation train again and hopefully these two will start talking to one another. "What are you going to college for?"</p>

<p>"Forensic stuff, probably something like accounting since numbers come easy to me." He shrugged. "There's some intense classes I have to take in a few semesters."</p>

<p>Bruce perked up hearing that and put his hands on the table. "Wait, really?" Edward gave him a weird look. "Uh, yeah." He shrugged and grabbed another breadstick from the bag. Greasy and unhealthy but so addicting and tasty.</p>

<p>"That's unique." Bruce commented, unsure what else to say. He was just as, if not more, awkward than Edward at talking to others. Selina wanted to facepalm.</p>

<p>"Why are you in college?" Edward asked. It wasn't a "what degree are you going for" or anything else. He was genuinely confused why someone like Bruce would need, or want, a degree in the first place.</p>

<p>"Money can not back everything I do. I have to be self sustainable." Bruce was watching Edward for his reaction to this answer. A lot of people only wanted to hang out with him <i>because</i> he was Bruce Wayne, or for his money, status, whatever else. Even without knowing Edward long he could tell this guy would probably rather never talk to him than try and befriend him.</p>

<p>He was definitely someone Bruce could trust, and not many people like that came around.</p>

<p>"At least you have a smart brain within that noggin." Edward finished his breadstick and wiped his hands on a cheap napkin the pizza place packed. He winced at the texture. "Where's the bathroom?"</p>

<p>Selina pointed to a door just a few feet away. When Edward left she scooted closer to Bruce and smirked at him. "So? Am I a good match maker or what?"</p>

<p>"Shut up." Bruce grumbled. It was true he found Edward cute but looks weren't enough. "I know you. You don't warm up to just anyone like that." Selina poked his cheek with a shit eating grin. "Is it the glasses?" "Selina I will kill you and not come to your funeral if you keep this up." "Awe, so harsh! Will you visit my grave at least? Buy me a rose and watch it wilt?"</p>

<p>Bruce nudged her playfully with his shoulder. "Are you just trying to pay me back for hooking you up with Anika?" "Mayyyybee~ But I do think you could at least try it with Ed. I know you and your stalker tendances. You already looked him up, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Stalker tendances?!" Bruce hissed out, offended, but blushed scarlet from being called out. "I had to make sure he wasn't a weirdo."</p>

<p>"But he is a weirdo." Selina rolled her eyes. "We all are."</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> what I mean. A creep, or someone who has underlying motives." Bruce closed the empty pizza box and sighed. "He probably won't like me."</p>

<p>"He just met you. Chill the hell out." Selina whacked the top of Bruce's head jokingly. The bathroom door opened and Edward stepped out drying his hands on his sweatshirt before sitting back down beside Selina.</p>

<p>"We should play a game." Selina beamed. Edward gave her a look. "Don't you have an essay to write?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shit. Whatever, that can wait." She waved her hand dismissively. "We have uno or we could try gartic phone."</p>

<p>Edward rolled his eyes and looked to Bruce. "What do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I have some work I'd like to finish today." He looked at Selina, then sighed. "But.. it isn't due for a while."</p>

<p>There was a lot of cussing during uno, especially when someone would skip another. Honestly it was adorable when Bruce would skip Selina just to see Edward's smug face. It was hilarious to then +4 him multiple times in a row after he got to uno. He was extremely expressive, but also calculating. Uno was half luck and half skill.</p>

<p>Somehow Selina always won though. Bruce and Edward were mainly focused on one another, trying to make sure they never had uno or the ability to win.</p>

<p>After their third loss in a row with Selina reaping all the rewards (calling them idiots) Selina made a bet. "If I win the next one you two will have to exchange numbers."</p>

<p>God she was evil. They wanted to win, but both of them wanted each others number by this point. This was a ploy on Selina's end to win <i>and</i> hook these two up.</p>

<p>Bruce pulled out his phone and handed it to Edward. Edward glanced to Selina with a smirk and added his contact into Bruce's phone.</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes but internally was cheering. This was actually working. "Whatever. I'll just change my bet."</p>

<p>Bruce took his phone back and hummed, looking it over. Selina got a devious idea. "If I win then you two have to have to hang out without me here."</p>

<p>Edward rubbed his face in annoyance. He was positive Selina was just determined for him to step out of his comfort zone and meet someone else while Bruce knew the real reason. She was doing everything to make them friends, then partners.</p>

<p>It was the same issue as before though. "And if either of us win?" Bruce questioned her. "I don't know! You make that stipulation."</p>

<p>It didn't matter anyway. They were not trying to win. Edward actually found he enjoyed hanging out with Bruce which was a shock. He rarely found anyone tolerable let alone liked being around them.</p>

<p>"Do you drink, Ed?" Selina asked as she placed down her final card, securing her win. Edward stared at her empty hands before smiling softly. "Not really, no. And no I don't do drugs either."</p>

<p>"Vanilla. Raw dogging life I see." Selina nodded. "Well if you want to drink or smoke just ask."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Edward said quietly, clearly not interested. Bruce took the deck of cards and shuffled them expertly before putting them back into the box. "Aw, you tired of me kicking yalls ass?" Selina teased. Bruce rolled his eyes. "No. I want to get to work and you have an essay to do." This was true, but just looking at Edward he could tell the guy hit his social battery even if he didn't realize it.</p>

<p>Selina hummed and stretched before standing up. "Wanna take the pizzas with you, Eddie?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh, no thanks." Edward got up and waved bye to Bruce before walking over to Selina and gently nudging her with his elbow as he passed by. "Thanks for today. It was really nice."</p>

<p>"You can drop by any time unannounced." She winked at him, making him blush softly. "Uh," He looked away and shuffled to the door. "See you in class."</p>

<p>When the door closed Selina turned around and whooped. "You." Selina ran over to Bruce and hugged his head from behind. "Tell me how you feel about him now that you two hung out~"</p>

<p>Bruce closed the uno box and huffed. "He is.." What was a good word that wouldn't make Selina set them up anymore? "A good guy." That response earned him a solid whack. "Liar."</p>

<p>There was no winning with her. "Okay fine. I really liked him. He isn't boring or overbearing and doesn't give a shit I'm a Wayne." Bruce gently shrugged Selina off, then paused. "I.. don't think he is aware we share a class."</p>

<p>Selina smirked knowingly. "Perfect thing to text him about then."</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>Bruce waited until Sunday afternoon to text Edward. The man probably needed to recharge, do work, homework, or other life things anyway. He didn't want to bother him that much. Yet somehow.. things ended up like this and they talked until 11 pm.</p><div class="container">

<p class="reply">Hey Edward</p>

<p class="reply">Its Bruce</p>

<p class="text">Hey. How are you? Thank you for the pizza by the way, I can't remember if I told you that before.</p>

<p class="reply">No problem. Were you aware we shared a class?</p>

<p class="text">We do? Which one? And how do you remember me?</p>

<p class="reply">Its the same class with Selina. I sit right beside her.</p>

<p class="text">Holy shit.</p>

<p class="text">Sorry, I never realized that was you.</p>

<p class="reply">No worries</p>

<p class="reply">I didnt expect you to remember me or anything, there wasnt a reason to</p>

<p class="text">How come Selina never said anything about her roommate being right there??</p>

<p class="text">Wait a damn minute.</p>

<p class="text">If we all share a class how come she texted me about what the project was and didn't just as you?</p>

<p class="reply">Because she is a conniving piece of work</p>

<p class="text">She really did this to make us hang out, didn't she?</p>

<p class="reply">Yeah most likely.. sorry</p>

<p class="text">Don't apologize. We will just have to pay her back one day.</p>

<p class="reply">Despite that, are you ok?</p>

<p class="text">What do you mean? I'm alright. Why?</p>

<p class="reply">Selina talks about you a lot and we were both worried you over exerted yourself or something</p>

<p class="text">It was a new experience but I wasn't overwhelmed or anything. Just tired by the end.</p>

<p class="text">What about you?</p>

<p class="reply">?</p>

<p class="reply">Wdym</p>

<p class="text">Selina sprung this on you, a total (or almost total) stranger hanging out with you. Not only that but you bought the stranger pizza and were forced to play horrible games where we lost with him.</p>

<p class="reply">Ngl that made me chuckle. Nah its okay, really. Id buy you pizza anytime</p>

<p class="text">Why?</p>

<p class="reply">Youre a cool guy</p>

<p class="text">I'm sure you've met hundreds of cooler people than me. I've been called a nerd, dweeb, four eyes, smart ass, and more. I don't party or do "cool" things.</p>

<p class="reply">And?</p>

<p class="text">..?</p>

<p class="reply">I see you as cool so thats what matters, right?</p>

<p class="text">Ok you got me there I guess.</p>

<p class="text">Thanks.</p>

<p class="reply">For what? Being nice?</p>

<p class="text">No.</p>

<p class="text">Well yes, actually.</p>

<p class="text">Not many people even acknowledge my existence let alone give a shit about me.</p>

<p class="reply">They are missing out then</p>

<p class="text">No need to butter me up. I already like you.</p>

<p class="reply">:)</p>

<p class="text">Ok I am judging you heavily.</p>

<p class="reply">What? Why??</p>

<p class="text">":)" Is so outdated.</p>

<p class="reply">No it isn't! What do you use then?</p>

<p class="text">Of a face I can use at any time if it wasn't cringe?</p>

<p class="reply">Yep</p>

<p class="text">Oh shut up.</p>

<p class="text">I was kidding.</p>

<p class="text">Sorry, did I go too far?</p>

<p class="text">Oh my god you are insufferable.</p>

<p class="reply">And is that why you're texting me at 10:45 pm?</p>

<p class="text">Ah shit I need to sleep soon. Wby?</p>

<p class="reply">Probably. I'm a night guy though, I sleep more during the day</p>

<p class="text">Oh.</p>

<p class="reply">Dw its just a medical thing, I get enough hours</p>

<p class="text">Alright well, see you tomorrow then. Make sure Selina did her project.</p>

<p class="reply">Will do</p></div>

<p>Bruce stared at his phone on the last message sent at almost 11 pm for a while. He had no idea why he cared this much about this conversation. At least he learned a little bit about Edward. He really was a good guy even if he tried not to show it. He was actually looking forward to being Edward's friend.</p><center>

<p>&lt;?&gt;</p></center>

<p>It had been a while since Selina <s>forced</s> introduced them to one another, and safe to say Edward was going insane. They had formed a group chat on discord with just the three of them and Edward regretted making it. All they ever do is ping him to show him memes when he was studying. At least the VC'ing with music was nice when they were not hanging out in real life.</p>

<p>But besides that.. They were in their next semester and didn't share any classes so any time after college they (mainly Selina) would <s>ask</s> force Edward to drop by their dorm to hang out. It happened so often that some days he just spent the night there since it was easier.</p>

<p>It really did not take long for Edward to find a rhythm with these huge changes though. He liked being apart of their lives.</p>

<p>Bruce was not the guy he thought he'd be, which was "Rich prick asshole". Not only did they all take turns paying for food or the like, Bruce never felt overbearing with money or his status. Edward truly liked that about him.</p>

<p>Currently he was <i>trying</i> to study for an important test. Keyword: trying. They were yapping on discord and it was quite frankly distracting. He hopped on discord to reply once before going back to studying. He'd come to regret that later.</p><div class="window theme-dark">

<p>All Edward knew was that he muted the chat and then went back to studying, oblivious of what his friends were plotting. It was only a little while later when Selina and Anika showed up at the same time carrying a big bag of Wendy's. They had been to every floor looking around for him and finally found him on the third one.</p>

<p>"Eddie!" Selina called out waving her hand gleefully. He looked up at her then froze. "Oh, you're shitting me.." "Nope." She and Anika sat at the other side of the table from him and opened the bag, taking everything out. "Your Wendy's," Anika said a bit amusedly.</p>

<p>"You are so evil. I'm studying. I would have been home after my classes today." Edward grumbled and grabbed his wrap and opened it up, eating while they talked. "Yeah well that was in a long time and you so rudely tried to shut <i>us</i> up when you could have just muted the chat."</p>

<p>Edward sighed deeply and shook his head. "You just get a kick out of messing with me." "Nah I just love seeing my friends."</p>

<p>Anika and her shared a frosty with Selina as Edward searched through the bag. He saw nuggets among other things and took it out. "For Bruce?"</p>

<p>"Hm? Oh yeah he may be on his way." Anika said like she was just realizing that could happen. Edward stole one nugget and put it back in the bag. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Well he wanted to stop us from seeing you." Selina hummed innocently. She then leaned forward with a smirk. "I see how you look at him, Eddie."</p>

<p>Edward gave her a very confused look and took a slow bite of his wrap. "My gaydar is going off." She hinted. Edward kept looking at her like she sprouted a second head.</p>

<p>Selina groaned and rolled her eyes. "Eddie I know you have a crush on Bruce."</p>

<p>He choked on his bite of food and gulped it down before glaring hard at her. "What the hell, Selina?" "Whaaat?" She smirked. "It's obvious."</p>

<p>Edward glanced to Anika who nodded in agreement. "It kind of is."</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> is it obvious? Does he know?" Edward pressed for details. "Hmm, I think he is too dense to realize." Selina tutted. "But it just is. You <i>look</i> at him like you don't with others, you know? Plus you always go easy on him during uno and shit!"</p>

<p>"Thats because we need to team up against your Undefeatable ass," Edward made a weak excuse. "I don't have a crush on him. He is my friend and I like him."</p>

<p>Selina and Anika cast one another a knowing look. "You are scared things will change if you tell him you like him, right?"</p>

<p>Edward's lips went into a thin line. Seems they hit the jackpot. "If you think he will drop you like a fly for that then you don't know him at all." Selina pointed out almost like he was lecturing him. Anika took over and tried to help. "Do you think he won't like you back?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, obviously." Edward rolled his eyes and took his final bite of wrap. "Why is that?" Anika pressed on.</p>

<p>"I am not someone that is datable. I'm a random nobody. While I know Bruce is Bruce he is still Bruce <i>Wayne</i>. He will probably want to date a supermodel or someone with power or talent. Someone hot and sexy." The 'anyone but me' hung in the air silently.</p>

<p>Selina reached over and whacked the top of his head. "Have you ever seen him hang out with anyone hot?"</p>

<p>Edward gave her a look. "Yeah. You two." She huffed. "Ok what I meant was have you ever seen Bruce hang out with anyone else?"</p>

<p>"No. Just us I guess. Why does that matter?" Edward mumbled.</p>

<p>"Because he is demisexual but also because he doesn't let just <i>anyone</i> into his life. Random hot people included." Selina sat back down and pointed at him. "So if you confess to him he wouldn't want to lose you as a friend."</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean it won't be awkward after." Edward scratched his cheek lightly, contemplating. "Don't either of you dare tell him either." Edward sighed and ran a hand through his hair before slowly slumping onto the table. "I'm fucked."</p>

<p>Selina ruffled his hair and hummed. "Why don't you look for signs that he is interested in you?"</p>

<p>"Selina.." Edward said a bit muffled from speaking into the table. "I've never had a crush on anyone before let alone someone being interested in me. How the <i>fuck</i> am I supposed to tell?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you do?" Selina hummed. "You treat Bruce different because you love him differently compared to me. You'd go and stay with him if he was sick while you'd just get me medicine. Or you share food with one another but won't let me have any. Shit like that. What does Bruce do with you versus us?"</p>

<p>Edward rolled his head to the side to look up at her with a slightly hopeful expression. "I guess I will have to learn how to study Bruce then."</p>

<p>"That's a class I'd ace." Selina smirked. Anika nudged her and they both looked to where Anika was looking. Bruce had just stepped out of the elevator holding his phone and scanning the floor. They locked eyes and he walked over and groaned. "You two seriously came and bothered him?"</p>

<p>"And you failed to stop us." Selina smirked, glancing at Ed like 'look, heres reason number one'.</p>

<p>"I did fail." Bruce sat beside Edward with slumped shoulders. Edward sat up and grabbed the fast food bag and slid it over to Bruce. "They got you nuggets." Luckily that improved Bruce's mood somewhat. He took the nuggets out and counted them before huffing. "They gave me 9 instead of 10."</p>

<p>"I ate one." Edward looked away, feeling a bit guilty. Bruce playfully nudged him with his shoulder. "At least it was one. Selina would have eaten the whole thing."</p>

<p>"Oh my god shut up." Selina hissed out. Anika snorted and fed Selina a bite of frosty to silence her temporarily. "So other than the disruption, hows studying?" Bruce looked at Edward with a small smile.</p>

<p>"Good..? Maybe. Hell if I know." Edward rubbed his own forehead and sighed. "I'm ready for winter break."</p>

<p>Anika snorted. "We just had fall break." "It wasn't enough." Edward grumbled and leaned back in his chair. "What are you guys doing for christmas anyways?"</p>

<p>"Me and Anika are going to visit her family three hours away for a week and a half. You two will have to do grocery runs without me." Selina hummed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to visit family so won't be staying at the dorm." Bruce said quietly. He looked at Edward with a soft expression. "Are, uh, you doing anything?"</p>

<p>Edward crossed his arms and sighed. "No. I don't have anyone." So that meant he'd be alone for a week or more during Christmas no less. Bruce put his hand on Edward's shoulder and shook it lightly. "You can come with me."</p>

<p>"..What?" Edward looked at him shocked, then pulled back. "I'm not ruining your time with your family."</p>

<p>"Ruin? I'd love it if you came with. It wouldn't be a bother." Bruce booped his glasses playfully. "Plus I'd be upset if you were alone for that long in our dorm."</p>

<p>"I'll be fine. Your family doesn't even know I exist or has met me before.." Edward fixed his glasses. "They know about you. And so what? Is me not inviting you and wanting you there not enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh my fucking god Ed," Selina groaned. "Just say yes." Anika was nodding, agreeing with her.</p>

<p>Edward felt his ears turn a deep red. "Christ.. ok. If you truly don't mind then I'll go with you." He glanced at Bruce to see his reaction and blushed even harder when he saw a big grin on his face. Bruce didn't often smile and when he did it was always small unless they were playing a game like Cards Against Humanity or something to make him really laugh. Damn his heart for skipping a beat.</p>

<p>"I'll make preparations for when we do this in December." Bruce beamed. "Preparations?" Edward questioned, sitting up straight. "They hell do you mean?"</p>

<p>"To Wayne manor?" Bruce said like it was obvious. "Plus I need to inform Alfred and Dory we have a new guest."</p>

<p>"I'm killing you if there's anything expensive related to this trip." Edward grumbled. Anika and Selina stood up and gathered the trash from their lunch. "We are gonna head out now. Have fun you two~"</p>

<p>Bruce waved to them while Edward playfully flipped off Selina. Bruce snorted when he saw his gesture and stretched his legs. "Are you leaving too?" Edward tilted his head a bit.</p>

<p>"Hmm.. No. I have to study too. Might as well do it together, right?" He gave the other a warm smile that made Edward's heart stutter again. He was fucked.</p>
